*Date: 05/23/2024*

## Overview
This repository contains the projects completed for UCSB's CMPSC 165A course on Artificial Intelligence.

### Projects
1. **Classifier Agent**
   - Developed a simple yet robust classifier agent employing both gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent methodologies.
   - Utilized logistic loss to update the gradient, ensuring efficient model optimization.
   - Conducted an in-depth comparative analysis between gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent techniques, exploring their respective strengths and weaknesses in classification tasks.

2. **Pac-Man (Basic)**
   - Created a single-agent Pac-Man simulation featuring an intuitive graphical interface.
   - Implemented various navigational algorithms to guide Pac-Man through mazes, including:
     - Depth First Search: An algorithm exploring as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
     - A* Heuristic Search: A sophisticated algorithm combining greedy and informed search strategies to find the shortest path efficiently.
     - Iterative Deepening Search: A hybrid algorithm offering the efficiency of breadth-first search with the optimality of depth-first search by gradually increasing the depth limit.

3. **Pac-Man (Reinforcement Learning)**
   - Expanded the basic Pac-Man simulation to include multiple agents, incorporating ghost characters to increase complexity and challenge.
   - Implemented advanced Reinforcement Learning techniques to enhance Pac-Man's decision-making capabilities, including:
     - Mini-Max: A decision-making algorithm used in game theory to minimize potential losses.
     - Expecti-Max: An extension of Mini-Max that considers probabilistic outcomes, enabling Pac-Man to anticipate and respond to uncertain environments effectively.
